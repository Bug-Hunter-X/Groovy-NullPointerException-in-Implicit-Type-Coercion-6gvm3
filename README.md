This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to implicit type coercion and null values. The `myMethod` function attempts to add two numbers but doesn't properly handle null inputs. While a null check is implemented, the addition itself may still fail if one of the inputs is null, leading to a NullPointerException. The solution shows a more robust way to handle null inputs and avoid the exception.
